# The-second-or-The-third-largest-element
#Explanation:
#Array Initialization: The array is predefined with integer values.
#Initialization of Variables: The variables second and third are initialized to -1, which will hold the second and third largest numbers respectively.
#Finding Values: The program iterates through the array:
If the current array element is greater than second, it updates third to second (the previous second largest) and sets second to the current element.
If the current element is greater than third and not equal to second, it updates third.
#Output: Finally, the program prints out the second and third largest numbers.
This code does not require user input and focuses solely on retrieving the second and third largest numbers from the predefined array. You can run this code in any C++ environment to see the results.
